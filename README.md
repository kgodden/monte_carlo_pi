# monte_carlo_pi
Estimate Pi using simple Monte Carlo simulation without *using* Pi (cf. Buffon's Needle)

Imagine that you are stranded on a desert island and you need to calculate Pi to a few decimal places, what are you going to do?

Well you could draw some parallel lines in the sand and throw a stick over and over again to find out how many times it crosses a line,  that's the Buffon desert island approach, see: https://github.com/kgodden/buffon_needle

Another approach is to draw a circle in the sand and throw a pebble over and over again to see how many times it lands inside the circle or in the bounding box, this script has a go at simulating this!

The estimate of Pi tends to converge faster than when simulating the Buffon approach
